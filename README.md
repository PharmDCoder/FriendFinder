# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

## Application Overview: 
Friend Finder is a compatibility-based application that compares user's results from a survey to a hard coded database of friends to determine the most compatible match. After completing the survey, the app will then display the name and picture of the friend that is the best overall match.

## Utility:  
Friend finder is a full stack app that is useful for comparing the behavior/interests of several people to the behaviors and interests of the user to determine who is the most similar based on the absolute value difference between score totals.

## Instructions:  
### 1. Click on this Link to access the friend finder website: https://friend-finder-pharm-d-coder.herokuapp.com/
### 2. Click on the "Take Survey" button to access the survey.
### 3. Fill out the survey and then click the "Submit" button to have a module pop up with the closest friend match.
### Footer Links:
    1. API Friends Link - will show you the JSON data of all of the hard coded friends and most recent user to fill out the survey.
    2. Github Repo Link - will take you to the repository page for the creator of the app.


# Technologies Deployed: 
  1. node.js (platform for executing JavaScript code server-side)
  2. npm "express" - handles routing
  3. npm "path" - the path.dirname() method returns the directory name of a path
  4. heroku - used as a host to deploy the app with git so the app can be accessed from a website link.
  5. .gitignore - this file allows developer to choose which files not to upload to the repository (mySQL password as well as the cumbersome node_modules file)
